Today I learned that the cotton fishnet shirt known in Jamaica as the _mesh marina_ has Norwegian roots. One Henrik Natvig Brun started developing it in 1921 as a “health vest” to keep troops warm and dry. Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay wore it when they summited Mount Everest in 1953. Bob Marley wore it when he met Eric Clapton in 1975.
