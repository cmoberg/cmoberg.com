Today I learned that the community anarchist group "The Diggers" held a mock funeral for the Hippie movement in 1968 in the Haight Ashbury area in San Francisco.

The Diggers was closely associated with somewhat violent street theatre-company named the San Francisco Mime Troupe so you know they meant business.

Now _you_ know!
