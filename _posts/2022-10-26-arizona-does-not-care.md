Today I learned that the state of Arizona does not observe daylight saving time.

If that was not astonishing enough, it turns out that the [Navajo Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_Nation) which is a Native American reservation occupying portions of northeastern Arizona **does** observe DST.

And to top it off; the [Hopi Reservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_Nation) which is not part of Navajo Nation, but geographically surrounded by it also **does not** observe DST.

Here's a picture of the mess:

Now *you* know!
