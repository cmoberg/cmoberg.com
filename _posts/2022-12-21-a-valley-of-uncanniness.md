Today I learned that the uneasy feeling I get from seeing badly rendered humanoids is described in a hypothesis called the _Uncanny Valley_. It states that there is a valley of revulsion between "somewhat human" and "fully human" as proven in films featuring computer-generated characters ranging from the 2004 _The Polar Express_ to the 2019 rendition of _Cats_.
