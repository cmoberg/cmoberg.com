title:  The oboe rules the pitch

Today I learned that orchestras tune to the oboe, and they tune to 'A4' at 440 Hz[^1].

They do this because the oboe has a penetrating sound, is rich in overtones, and has a very stable pitch by mechanical design.

Now *you* know.

[^1]: Some western European orchestras tune to 442 Hz, and some central European orchestras tune to 443 Hz.
